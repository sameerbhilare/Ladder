1. The package "com.laddermaster.game.elements" contains elements for creating the Game Board.
   E.g. A game board contains - Snakes, Ladders, Dice and Players.
   
2. GameRunnerImpl.java has all the logic for playing the game.

3. To play the game test cases, Run "TestLadderMaster.java" as Run as Junit to execute test cases.

4. I have included logger statements to know each step of the players.

5. You can have any number of players, snakes, ladders in the game. You can configure these in "TestGameBoardFactory.java" class.
   This is the class which gives me the GameBoard instance.
